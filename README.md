# FT_Container

![Cromalde's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/cromalde/ft_containers)

Deep look into the STL library of c++, we have to reimplement the standard containers using the appropriate data structure.

For Queue and Stack i use the List container as substructure, because the Deque is requested as a bonus.
